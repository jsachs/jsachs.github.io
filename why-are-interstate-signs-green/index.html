				<p>The <a href="http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/kno-colorspec.htm">Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices</a> specifies Green 342 for use in matching the standard green used in traffic control signs. However, "the Pantone specifications are not for use in sign fabrication".  It is shockingly difficult to find an exact color specification for traffic signs, and there is almost no documented evidence detailing the motivation behind the choice of color for the iconic green traffic sign.</p>

<p><a href="http://img.svbtle.com/grggnetbseswlw.jpg"><img src="https://d23f6h5jpj26xu.cloudfront.net/grggnetbseswlw_small.jpg" alt="pantone_342.jpg" title=""></a></p>

<p>Entering "why are roadsigns" into Google suggests "why are roadsigns green" as the top answer. Yet the top two hits are <a href="http://askville.amazon.com/signs-expressway-green-white/AnswerViewer.do?requestId=1544392">Amazon Askville</a> and <a href="https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20071217112239AAEIDcd">Yahoo Answers</a> posts from 2007--not very encouraging.</p>

<p>We can start to make some sense from basic principles of readability. White text on a dark background is easier to read at night. This is the same reason your GPS will switch over to "night mode" and invert the color scheme.</p>

<p><a href="http://img.svbtle.com/zaiaawpojcclaa.png"><img src="https://d23f6h5jpj26xu.cloudfront.net/zaiaawpojcclaa_small.png" alt="night_mode.png" title=""></a></p>

<p>This technique has been used in road signs for a long time. Before the 1950s and the completion of the Eisenhower Interstate Highway System, California had the largest network of highways in the country. Most of their guide signs were black with white text. When the MUTCD was <a href="http://www.ehow.com/facts_5780285_highway-signs-green_.html">revised in 1954</a>, it standardized this practice. However, they switched the signage from black to dark green.</p>

<p>I have yet to find a definitive source on why this green was chosen, but here are some leading hypotheses. It's likely a combination of some or all of these ideas.</p>

<h2 id="greenmeansgo">Green means go</h2>

<p>For drivers around the world, it's universal to associate green with go, and warm colors with some degree of yielding. Directional signs are only meant to guide on a continuing journey. Following a green sign would usually mean taking an exit, a turn, or just knowing how much further you need to go.</p>

<p>Red or yellow would obviously have the wrong association. They mean caution, yield, or stop. This leaves us with a few other options, such as blue or brown.</p>

<p>However, taken in the context of driving, it's not enough to make a sign say "don't stop". Directional signs say where to go when we keep moving, making green a strong candidate.</p>

<h2 id="greenisntdistracting">Green isn't distracting</h2>

<p>What do you see when you travel US interstates, on both sides for thousands and thousands of miles?</p>

<p>Trees.</p>

<p>Green blends in. Green is only there if you're looking for it. Need to find exit 163? Keep your eyes peeled, and it will be easy to spot the sign. It's not going to grab your attention if you don't need it, though.</p>

<p>Important signs--construction, closures, etc.--are yellow and orange. Signs reporting danger are often red. Even more benign informational signs, like rest stops, come in a warm brown or brighter shades of blue.</p>

<p>Directional signs are <em>everywhere</em>. It would be overwhelming if every city sign, milage post, or exit popped out at you during your drive.</p>

<p>In fact, it's already shown to be a problem. <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2285668/Car-crash-Blame-road-signs-Third-drivers-accident-near-miss-baffling-signs.html">A 2013 study</a> showed that almost half of British drivers find themselves distracted by road signs. In <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/apr/02/transport.psychology">a 2008 study</a>, the Guardian reported, reaction times increased by 100 milliseconds when drivers were "overloaded" with information.</p>

<p>There's certainly a need for road signs, and color alone won't correct larger design problems. However, minimizing distraction is a key step in driver safety.</p>

<h2 id="greenisreflective">Green is reflective</h2>

<p>Light reflectance value (LRV) indicates the percentage of light reflected from an illuminated surface.  We've already mentioned that road signs should be dark with white lettering, for readability at night. However, we still want the sign itself to be as visible as possible. This means we need a color that contrasts well with white, and has a high LRV.</p>

<p>Shades of black are at or around an LRV of 0. The other colors that generally contrast well with white are gray, red, orange, and the darker shades of green, blue, and violet.</p>

<p>As previously mentioned, we'll want to take red, orange, and violet out due to their connotations.  Let's say we had the choice between dark blue, dark green, grey, and brown.</p>

<table style="width:100%">  
  <tr>
    <th>Color</th>
    <th>LRV</th> 
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><a href="http://www.resene.co.nz/swatches/preview.php?chart=Resene%20Multi-finish%20range%20%282008%29&amp;brand=Resene&amp;name=Alfresco">Green</a></td>
    <td>17</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>

    <td>15</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><a href="http://www.resene.co.nz/swatches/preview.php?chart=Resene%20The%20Range%20fashion%20colours%2016&amp;brand=Resene&amp;name=Bellbottom%20Blue">Blue</a></td>
    <td>13</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>

    <td>10</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Along with the previously discussed psychological factors, green is in general a very visible dark color. Choosing some shade of green for directional signs appears to be a logical choice.</p>

<h2 id="butwhythisgreen">BUT, why this green???</h2>

<p>Among all this information, I could not find a history of how this exact shade of green was decided. It's undoubtedly one of the most iconic and widely recognized colors on Earth, but it has no well-defined history. I'm desperate for an answer.</p>
