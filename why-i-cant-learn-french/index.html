				<p>Since June, 2013 (about 10 months ago) I've been trying to gain basic fluency in French.  My girlfriend is French-Canadian. French is her first language. While the language preferences of the rest of her family are all over the map, the rub is that a great number of their friends speak almost entirely French.</p>

<p>There have been some uncomfortable evenings when she is forced to translate everything for me. It becomes tedious and awkward for both of us. It also feels wrong that I am incapable of communicating with my partner in her first language.</p>

<p>I had been toying around with <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/">Duolingo</a>, so I continued working my way through its translation exercises. I also began using <a href="http://www.pimsleur.com/">Pimsleur</a> language tapes.  A few years ago, I'd used these tapes to help me in my high school Japanese class.  They were good, but I hadn't put in the time to make any real progress.</p>

<p>10 months later, I'm having the same problem; I am not making the commitment to do something as challenging as learning a new language.</p>

<p>There are a few obvious problems, the first of which is time. I've made it through the first 60 lessons in my tapes.  This accounts for only about 30 hours of conversation.  That number is less than the French I would speak with two days of immersion.  I am not brilliant enough to pick up a language in two days.</p>

<p>The next problem is consistency. I have good stretches. I think I was up to an hour a day before leaving on vacation for Paris. The extra practice didn't do a damn thing, but it eased my guilty conscience.</p>

<p>Both of these problems are at odds with a busy work schedule, and a lazy twenty-something. There are people in college courses, practicing hundreds of hours a year, who still struggle to pick up a language. If this is what it takes, I'm doomed.</p>

<p>Plenty of working adults manage to learn new languages. The vast majority of people in the world do not learn new languages in institutes of higher learning. They are learned organically, in practice, out of necessity.  If I am to succeed, I need to efficiently recreate these conditions. Immersion is out of the question, at least for the time-being.  The question then becomes, "what are the key consequences of immersion?"</p>

<hr>

<p>It's about 8pm, and my girlfriend is sound asleep. I'm on a mission to Sushi Shop in Paris.  Armed with my minimal knowledge of transactional French, I'm confident that I can navigate the task of purchasing food.</p>

<p>I walk in the door and try my hardest to avoid eye contact. I'm sure there's a menu, with the option to order fresh, but there are enough choices on the ready-made shelf. The shelf doesn't try to talk to you.</p>

<p>I give a "bonsoir" to the cashier, and he tallies my items. I think I would have come close enough to the number he says to give proper change, but the register saves me the trouble.  As I hand him twenty euros, he asks, "salé ou sucré."</p>

<p>I freeze.</p>

<p>Sucré. That one is easy, "sweet". But I didn't quite catch the first word. I give a timid "pardon".  He repeats the phrase.  I'm panicking.  If I don't answer, he will clearly ask me to leave the shop, and my partner and I will not eat that night.  I blurt out "sucré".  He bags up my items, and I give a nearly silent "merci" before rushing out the door.</p>

<p>As it turns out, in France, you have the option of sweet or salty soy sauce.  I chose the sweet.  It was disappointing, and frustrating.  Figuring out such a softball of a question would have made my mediocre takeout far, far better.</p>

<hr>

<p>I was not simply forced to translate a new phrase. I had to do it alongside a new concept, while being put on the spot.  Translating literally to "salty or sweet" made no sense without cultural induction.</p>

<p>This moment captures the missing pieces from my French "education".  There is no genuine imperative to speak French. There is no context. Both of these force the real key to fluency, in my opinion: abstraction.</p>

<p>For a language to be second nature, it must be practiced in scenarios where it is not your first priority.  To speak the language, the language must vanish.  If I truly want to learn, I will need to incorporate these types of situations into my everyday study. Reading, writing, television, forcing my girlfriend to speak French with me.  A deck of flashcards is never going to teach me that France has weird sauces. </p>
