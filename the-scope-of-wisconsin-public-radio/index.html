            <p>Public radio has played a large part in my development.  Growing up, I was never one to read copies of the New York Times lying around, but every day to and from school the dial was tuned to 90.3, WCPN ("ideastream").  Public radio was my early worldview, but particularly important for learning about my city, Cleveland.  If you go to private school in the East suburbs, you probably aren't learning much about the City of Cleveland.  Sure, there were stories of crime and road construction.  But I also heard about our arts, our research.  I learned why we mattered, and where we fit in.</p>

<p>I moved to Madison, Wisconsin about six months ago.  It was time to get acquainted with a new public radio station.  I still had my <em>Morning Edition</em> and my <em>Talk of the Nation</em>.  But a few weeks ago, something really started to get to me.  The local AM news.  I came to dread it.  The soporific voice of Terry Bell could only mean that a great big wave of vanilla reporting was about to come crashing down.  I began flipping to the second available public radio station.  Each time, to my horror, there he was again--10 seconds in the future, but it was not the salvation I needed.</p>

<p><strong>Nothing New Happens in Wisconsin</strong></p>

<p>...or so WPR would have you believe.  Here is a list of things you are nearly guaranteed to hear about every week:</p>

<ul>
<li>Gogebic Taconite wants to drill more exploratory holes for their iron ore mine.  This might be bad for the environment, but no one seems to say why.  I still don't know anything about GTAC, but they sure do like drilling.</li>
<li>Someone was killed in Milwaukee.  If it's a bad week, someone will also be killed in Waukesha, and maybe Kenosha.</li>
<li>The state is considering changing education requirements.  The state decides it's too complicated to do so, but will probably reconsider in a few weeks.</li>
<li>The Department of Natural Resources changes hunting laws.  I'm sure I've been told half of the restrictions on hunting deer in the state, but I can't recount a single one at the moment.</li>
</ul>

<p>Not only are these stories repetitive and dull, but they aren't actually stories.  WPR news is simply relaying facts.  There is no analysis or investigation.  The morning local news doesn't need hard-hitting editorial content, but it should elaborate why what I am hearing is important to me as a citizen.</p>

<p>I jumped over to wcpn.org, the Ideastream homepage.  The two headlines for Northeast Ohio news were entitled <em>Northeast Ohioans on What They Hoped President Obama Would Address in State of the Union</em> and <em>Northeast Ohioans Report on the Fast-Breaking Events in Ukraine</em>.  In the first headline, the opinions of local citizens are connected to a national event.  In the second, several members of Cleveland's significant Ukranian population weigh in on an international crisis.  In both stories, WCPN combines local people, diverse opinions, and broadly-scoped events.</p>

<p>Wisconsin Public Radio is narrow.  It is narrow in the scope of events it covers, and narrow in the scope of opinions it presents.  The major headline on WPR.org: <em>Gov. Walker Will Meet President During Wisconsin Visit; Burke To Miss Him</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Governor Scott Walker will meet President Obama when the president visits
  Wisconsin Thursday, but Walker's Democratic challenger, Mary Burke, will
  be out of town.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>WPR is doing the opposite of ideastream.  They manage to take a national event, Obama's tour de force on the minimum wage, and pigeonhole it into a local framework.</p>

<p><strong>Good Local News Isn't Local</strong></p>

<p>This is a day's worth of case study, but take my word that this is an accurate representation of the differences between public radio in Cleveland and Wisconsin.  Cleveland public radio understands that the world is shrinking.  It provides information on the regional level, within the context of national and international communities.  I cannot remember a single story from WPR within a framework of globalization.  This isn't to say it hasn't happened, but it doesn't seem to be a high priority item on the agenda.</p>

<p>WPR is forced to generalize.  While ideastream caters only to Northeast Ohio, WPR must report the news for an entire state.  This means that in a state that sells 600,000 deer hunting licenses a year, the DNR is bound to pop up once or twice a week.  For many, it is need-to-know information.</p>

<p>But this rote reporting doesn't have to exclude analysis and investigation.  News is news, but I need to know <em>why</em> I should be listening just as much as I need to be told what's going on.  In the year 2014, there is almost always a reason to listen that extends beyond state lines.  I've only been here for six months.  I need to be convinced why my new state matters to the rest of the world.</p>
