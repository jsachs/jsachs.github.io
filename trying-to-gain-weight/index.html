				<p>Several months ago, I made a plan to log all of my food intake for a week. I've struggled to put on weight for a long time. I figured some basic analysis could help push me in the right direction.</p>

<p>The results make it clear that I have grossly underestimated the amount of effort required to create the change I want. Here's what the numbers look like.</p>

<p><a href="http://img.svbtle.com/ysmxuyeyggaomq.png"><img src="https://d23f6h5jpj26xu.cloudfront.net/ysmxuyeyggaomq_small.png" alt="week of macros.png" title=""></a></p>

<h2 id="theissues">The Issues:</h2>

<h3 id="followthrough">Follow-through</h3>

<p>On my first day of logging I got serious about eating. Five meals, high calorie, high protein. By the end of the week, there were days I was hardly eating enough to have good energy, let alone gain weight.</p>

<p>Keeping to a diet is a project, even if a large part of that diet is just eating more. On day one, increasing my food intake was on my mind all day.  By the end of the week, I was logging out of a feeling of obligation. I was tired. I'd lost respect for the genuine undertaking that is controlling and directing your eating. In just one week, I'd allowed food to settle back in to a thing of habit.</p>

<h3 id="volume">Volume</h3>

<p>Although I was doing a good job of monitoring my meals during the first four days, it doesn't look like it was enough. In order to gain weight there must be a significant net intake of calories.  For men, this starts at about 3,000 calories, and is probably much higher for me due to intense daily exercise.</p>

<p>On good days, I was just barely hitting the 3,000 mark, and fell far short by the end of the study. Telling myself <em>more</em> is a good start, but it needs a metric to aim for and judge success. Having a concrete number in mind would have helped in motivating food selection.</p>

<h3 id="protein">Protein</h3>

<p>The common wisdom is that athletes, particularly those trying to gain weight, should be eating one gram of protein per pound of bodyweight.  There were only two days (4/18 and 4/20) when I hit this benchmark.</p>

<p>I was making a very concerted effort to eat high-protein foods, and to choose the higher-protein option whenever possible.  However, this loops back to the issue of volume.  In order to consistently hit my protein benchmark, I need to consistently eat more.</p>

<h2 id="thewins">The Wins:</h2>

<h3 id="carbfatbalance">Carb/fat balance</h3>

<p>A common problem with eating more is that you will simply fill up your diet with useless extra calories. Carbs do a lot for energy, but the body still needs fat to function properly. The general guideline here is a half a gram per pound of bodyweight. This puts my fat intake on the higher end, but has the advantage of keeping excessive carb consumption down.</p>

<h3 id="software">Software</h3>

<p>I wrote a simple command-line tool for logging my meal data. It still needs a ton of work, but I find it much easier than using anything web-based for my daily needs. You can check it out <a href="https://github.com/jsachs/diet_analysis">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="theplan">The Plan:</h2>

<h3 id="moremeals">More meals</h3>

<p>My best day was the day when I ate five times.  More meals result in more nutrients. It also means relying less on high-carb foods to sustain an appetite between meals, making it easier to get calories from protein.</p>

<p>You've probably heard this before, as it is common advice to eat more small meals, rather than fewer big ones.  It's much easier said than done, but this is where the next point comes in.</p>

<h3 id="keepfoodaround">Keep food around</h3>

<p>Days are much better when I remember to bring a jar of peanut butter to my desk. I don't spend time feeling hungry, which allows me to make better eating decisions throughout the day. Bags of nuts make a good option as well.</p>

<p>Nut-based snacks are an excellent supplement between meals. They are high in protein and high in unsaturated fats, meaning they will tide you over with usable nutrients.</p>

<h3 id="countprotein">Count protein</h3>

<p>As stated earlier, it's hard to reach a goal without some sort of metric. Stating "I will eat more protein" is not a good way to track and manage protein intake.</p>

<p>160g. Every day. Logging it is a pain, but the only days I came remotely close to breaking 3,000 calories were when I hit this benchmark. Changing weight isn't something that you can will with a mindset. It's a project, and you need to work on it every hour of every day.</p>
