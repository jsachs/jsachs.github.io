            <p>The <a href="http://www.aeropress.com/">Aeropress</a> is a magical coffee tube. Grounds and hot water go in, you push down on the plunger, and what emerges is an incredible hybrid of espresso and drip coffee. The use of pressure gets you the strength of espresso, while immersion of the grounds gives you better flavor extraction at lower temperatures. These factors, along with a short brew time, keep the pH up as well, making it one of the smoothest cups of coffee you will ever drink.</p>

<p>While the core steps of brewing are simple, there is a colossal rabbit hole of voodoo when it comes to achieving the perfect brew. Take, for example, the first-place recipe from the 2014 <a href="http://worldaeropresschampionship.com/recipes/">World Aeropress Championship</a>:</p>

<ol>
<li>16.5g coffee, 78℃, 250cc soft mineral water, EK43 grind at 9.5  </li>
<li>Rinse normal paper filter, in standard position.  </li>
<li>40g of blooming water for 25 seconds, stir 5 times.  </li>
<li>Add 210g of water, stir once.  </li>
<li>Press very slowly for 75 seconds.  </li>
<li>Leave 45g.</li>
</ol>

<p>What do you mean "standard position"? Why five times, no more, no less? Even more confusing, let's look at the wining recipe from 2010:</p>

<ol>
<li>Boil the water (so it is 80 degrees when you pour it over the coffee)  </li>
<li>Grind the coffee, slightly finer than filter grind (20 grams)  </li>
<li>Aeropress upside down and soak the filter paper with hot water  </li>
<li>Put in the coffee and pour the 80 degrees water over it, almost to the top.  </li>
<li>Stir for 10-12 seconds  </li>
<li>Heat the cup, and then slowly push the coffee in the cup – stop before you hear the air.  </li>
<li>Serve</li>
</ol>

<p>In five years, the device has been turned upside-down, stirring has decreased, and we've added something called blooming. Some of this I don't want to get into, like stir numbers, or water quality, or <a href="https://prima-coffee.com/equipment/mahlkonig/ek43">$2,000 coffee grinders</a>, but many of the other details are quite interesting.</p>

<h2 id="blooming">Blooming</h2>

<p>A bloom is when you first saturate the coffee grounds with water, allowing them to soak before adding the rest of the brewing water. The technique gets used in pour-over brewing--this is the reason for funny gooseneck kettles, as it gives you the accuracy necessary to uniformly wet the coffee.</p>

<p>Baristas bloom because fresh coffee releases CO2. This gas will repel water, preventing the water from reaching the innermost parts of the grounds where the flavors and aromas lie. By adding just a bit of water initially, you can displace CO2 before you start to brew. Once the grounds are saturated, the brewing water will diffuse (basically switch places) with the bloom water. By fully soaking the grounds, we ensure maximum diffusion and flavor extraction.</p>

<h2 id="temperature">Temperature</h2>

<p>While the two examples above have very similar temperatures, the top three recipes from 2014 used water temperatures ranging from 76℃ to 92℃. However, these temperatures all tend to the low end, compared to drip coffee machines using temperatures 93℃ and above.</p>

<p>Basically, Aeropress temperature is about trying to hit a sweet spot. Because of the ability to bloom, the water doesn't have to be quite as hot as other methods. There has to be some heat to get extraction; otherwise the brew will be noticeably weak. Get too hot, and you will begin to denature the compounds that we're working so hard to cultivate.</p>

<h2 id="inversion">Inversion</h2>

<p>This is where things get funny. Could the orientation of the device really contribute to the quality of flavor?</p>

<p>Advocates of inversion argue that the method provides better immersion. Since the coffee sits on the rubber plunger, rather than the filter, water is guaranteed to pool at the bottom. This could be particularly beneficial to blooming, as the standard configuration allows water to begin to leak through the filter.</p>

<p>Given that the winners of the Aeropress championship go back and forth on which method to use, I can't see scientific or anecdotal evidence that once way is better. Pro for inversion: no leaking. Con for inversion: potential to spill during the flip.</p>

<p>I prefer to avoid leakage.</p>

<h2 id="remainingwater">Remaining water</h2>

<p>The 2014 winner gives a very specific volume of water to leave in the press, but the idea is generally to stop around the time that you hear hissing. The Aeropress hiss is just the sound of air moving through the filter, which means most of the water is through.</p>

<p>The remaining water is still in the coffee grounds. What these recipes are trying to avoid is squeezing the water out of the grounds. We've already talked about extracting flavor through diffusion, which happens through the exchange of water. We don't want to manually force out water where flavor has already been extracted, as this will lead to bitterness.</p>

<p>The hiss is a red flag to stop. Asking for 45g remaining is just using a wide buffer, to prevent any possibility of squeezing the grounds.</p>

<p>From what I can tell, these recipes are determined through experimental trial and error. No sign of genuine Aeropress theory out on the internet.</p>
