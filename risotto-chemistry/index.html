            <p>My parents recently took a class on cooking risotto. The preparation is notoriously difficult. Keep stirring, but not too often. Add liquid as you go–not too much and not too little. The dish represents a compulsive’s nightmare in the kitchen.</p>

<p>It turns out that most of the neuroses surrounding the dish are apocryphal, though they’re rooted in solid kitchen chemistry. I’ll walk through three of the key steps in risotto preparation: toasting the rice, adding broth, and stirring.</p>

<h2 id="whytoast">Why toast?</h2>

<p>Most recipes will tell you to toast your rice in the bottom of the pot before beginning to add stock. One theory is that toasting helps to make the risotto creamy. Another is that you provide the rice with a nice toasty flavor from putting it on direct heat.</p>

<p>It turns out that the sole benefit is flavor. You should actually be careful when heating your rice, to avoid robbing it of too much creaminess. Heating the raw rice with butter and oil will help to imbue the rice with great earthy flavors. The heat will also break down starches in the rice, but these starches ultimately provide risotto with its desirable creaminess.</p>

<p>There are two options to both add flavor and preserve your starches. The first is detailed in <a href="http://www.seriouseats.com/2011/10/the-food-lab-the-science-of-risotto.html">a great article by The Food Lab</a>, which delves further into the matter of toasting. The starches that thicken risotto are on the surface of the grains of rice. By rinsing off the rice and collecting the water, you can first toast, then add starchy water in tandem with the stock. This is a similar technique to many pasta recipes calling to preserve a cup or two of water for the sauce.</p>

<p>My preferred strategy is to simply go for a short toasting. If you've started by cooking shallots and/or garlic at the bottom of your pot, many of the roasted flavors will already make it into your pasta.</p>

<h2 id="whyaddbrothslowly">Why add broth slowly?</h2>

<p>Most recipes will also tell you to add vegetable stock one ladleful at a time. The theories as to why vary quite a bit–the rice stays closer together, the rice cooks more evenly, or the liquid stays hotter are just a few.</p>

<p>Broth doesn’t really address the problem of getting the rice to cook evenly. The greatest temperature discrepancy will come from the height of the rice in the pot, which is largely a function of the pot itself. If you want more even cooking, you can use a wider pan or stir frequently–according to most sources, you should already be stirring until your arm hurts, though we’ll see this isn’t really true.</p>

<p>The grains of rice will indeed be in closer proximity with less liquid. The argument for doing this is to get more starch to rub off as you stir. However, with just the typical agitation you would get from stirring rice in water, you will still remove the majority of starch from the grains.</p>

<p>Keeping the average temperature of the liquid up is the closest theory to being correct. As you add stock and stir, much of the water is simply evaporating, and not being absorbed. With less stock–or as previously mentioned, a shallower pot–you achieve a higher surface area-to-volume ratio for the liquid, and persuade it to evaporate for quickly. The evaporation intensifies the flavors in the remaining stock, and eventually within the pasta. It’s the same idea as when you simmer down a sauce, except now you have rice cooking in the simmering liquid.</p>

<h2 id="whystir">Why stir?</h2>

<p>There is no greater torment associated with risotto than stirring. While hardliners will swear by stirring to the grave, there is no good chemical argument for why it should help.</p>

<p>As we’ve already seen, basic agitation is enough to remove starches from rice. By fifteen minutes of stirring, you aren’t doing anything to noticeably affect the sauce.</p>

<p>Does stirring allow the rice to cook more evenly? A little bit. If you keep the heat low and you keep your liquid shallow, the temperature differences throughout the rice should be minimal. If anything, give a few stirs through the middle of the pasta–this is where cooking will be most uneven.</p>

<p>Once again, the best solution: a wider pan.</p>
