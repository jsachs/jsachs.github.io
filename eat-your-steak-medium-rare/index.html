				<p>We don't eat steak because of the nutritional value. Top loins of beef have the same protein density as chicken breast, but with more fat and cholesterol. This is exactly what makes steak so delicious. "Well-marbled" meat is desirable because of the proliferation of tasty fat throughout the meat.</p>

<p>When cooking a steak, it is the chef's objective to take full advantage of all of this stored flavor.</p>

<p>Anything above 140ºF (medium) and you enter the danger zone of dryness. All of the delicious juices will have left your steak before it makes it to plate.  Furthermore, all of that great fat will be swirling in your pan or grill.</p>

<p>Most serious carnivores don't need much convincing to eat on the rarer side.  What I want to emphasize is that you can go too rare. Anything below 120ºF is just undercooked. Even at the traditional rare temperature, however, you will still be able to see the marbling in your meat. This means the succulent fat has not dispersed throughout the meat.</p>

<p>The melting point of animal fat can vary, but it generally occurs between 120ºF and 130ºF. By no coincidence, medium-rare happens to be at around 130ºF. This is the real purpose of medium-rare. It has nothing to do with color or tenderness. You are simply striking the balance between softening the fat and not drying out the meat.</p>

<p>For my two favorite guide on preparing a good steak, see <a href="http://www.seriouseats.com/2012/12/the-food-lab-complete-guide-to-pan-seared-steaks.html">here</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmC9SmCBUj4&amp;feature=kp">here</a>.</p>
