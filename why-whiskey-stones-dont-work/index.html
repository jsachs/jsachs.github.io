            <p>You've seen them. The basic (or sometimes very fancy) cubes that go in your cocktail. Some are made of granite or soapstone, while a few are made of metal. The idea is that they keep your drink cold, without the dilution that occurs with ice cubes.</p>

<p>If you've ever used them, you know that they do work, but not that well. The fundamental problem is that <em>whiskey stones are not made of ice</em>. This creates problems for two reasons: <em>specific heat</em> and <em>latent heat</em>.</p>

<h2 id="specificheat">Specific heat</h2>

<p>Some materials absorb energy better than others. This is because of a property called <em>specific heat</em>, or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_capacity"><em>heat capacity</em></a>. It is the ratio of the heating of an object to the change in temperature of an object (heat simply refers to the transfer of energy from a hotter body to a colder one). Objects with a low specific heat will rise and fall in temperature easily, while objects with a high specific heat are more resistant to temperature change.</p>

<p>To cool your drink, you want your cubes, whatever they're made of, to absorb as much energy as possible from your cocktail, thus lowering the temperature.</p>

<p>Consider something like a copper pot with a wooden handle. Hard woods have a specific heat approximately five times that of copper. Copper pots heat very quickly, which is part of why they are so valued in the kitchen. The wood handle, however, remains cool to the touch, because it takes so much more energy to adjust its temperature (a little bit of this has to do with thermal conductivity as well).</p>

<p>Ice has a specific heat almost seven times that of granite. If you put a cube of ice and a cube of granite in a drink, they will eventually reach the same temperature as the drink. However, due to heat capacity, the ice absorbs almost seven times the energy that granite does in the process.</p>

<h2 id="latentheat">Latent heat</h2>

<p>Ice does something important that granite does not--it melts in your drink. Ice and granite are both solids, with rigid, orderly molecular structures. In liquid water this structure is gone, and molecules flow freely. This means that if you have ice at 0ºC and water at 0ºC, the water actually has higher internal energy, due to the increased movement of its molecules.</p>

<p>This transformation (called a phase change) requires adding energy to the ice, while the temperature remains the same. This is actually the definition of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_heat"><em>latent heat</em></a>: the transfer of energy at constant temperature.</p>

<p>This gives ice a huge advantage over granite. When cold granite reaches the melting point of water, nothing special happens. It just continues to rise in temperature, and will probably reach equilibrium with your drink at a slightly-too-warm temperature. When ice reaches the melting point, it absorbs a huge amount of energy as it melts before continuing to rise in temperature. In fact, by mass, the energy absorbed by melting ice is over 150 times that of ice warming up by 1ºC.</p>

<p>With ice, we do still have the problem of diluting our drink. This is the reason for the advent of huge, <a href="http://www.japantrendshop.com/ice-ball-mold-for-perfect-ice-spheres-p-244.html">spherical ice cubes</a>. At the same volume, a cube has a 30% higher surface-area-to-volume ratio than a sphere, which means faster melting. Once we have a sphere, we can make this ratio smaller by making the sphere much bigger.</p>

<p>The cleverest solution is, bizarrely, <a href="http://www.bedbathandbeyond.com/store/product/30-reusable-ice-cubes/1016143944">reusable ice cubes</a>. Latent heat, without the dilution.</p>
