				<p>What, exactly, does this do?</p>

<p><a href="http://img.svbtle.com/cejoccbei4ipkg.jpg"><img src="https://d23f6h5jpj26xu.cloudfront.net/cejoccbei4ipkg_small.jpg" alt="google.jpg" title=""></a></p>

<p>What happens when you hit enter? Exploring this question from start to finish will help us discover layers of the internet that we take for granted every day.</p>

<h2 id="thedomainnamesystem">The Domain Name System</h2>

<p>The first thing that happens is your browser performs a DNS (domain name system) lookup. DNS exists because in reality, Google's address is not www.google.com. The address is numeric, something like <a href="http://74.125.224.72/">http://74.125.224.72/</a> (see where the link takes you!), and there are several that belong to Google. These numbers are harder to remember than google.com, so the architecture of the internet has a handy mnemonic system for remembering addresses.</p>

<p>A DNS lookup will translate the URL into a numerical address (an IP, or internet protocol address), and it does this recursively. The browser asks a master server--the root nameserver--where www.google.com is located. The root nameserver takes the rightmost piece of the name, .com, and gives another server to try. The browser then asks the .com server where www.google.com is located. The .com nameserver gives us the address of google.com. Finally, we ask the google.com server where www.google.com is located, and it responds with the fully resolved address.</p>

<p>I like using the analogy of a postal service when looking at network implementation. DNS is handed an envelope with nothing but a company name on the front, and adds the full address. Think of it as a humongous system of yellow pages.</p>

<h2 id="theinternetprotocol">The Internet Protocol</h2>

<p>We have an address. As a reminder, we're using this address to send a request for the Google home page. The IP address tells us where to send it. From our computer, information is guided by routers from network to network.</p>

<p>The internet exists in an extremely complex topology of networks, subnetworks, and boundaries. Within our postal service analogy, the internet protocol can be represented by addressed envelopes.  We determine where they go via a series of road signs and directions.</p>

<p>Each router has a table. This table contains a list of addresses known to this particular router. When the router gets an "envelope" of data, it looks at the address, and finds the closest match in the table. It then forwards the data along to this next location.</p>

<p>Imagine you're sending a letter from your home in Wisconsin to a friend in London. The postal service first sees that you are mailing to the UK, and forwards the mail from one country to another. Then the postal service sees that the letter is bound for somewhere in London, and will forward it to a London post office. This continues for postal code, and finally the street and number on the envelope.</p>

<h2 id="thetransmissioncontrolprotocol">The Transmission Control Protocol</h2>

<p>We can't send mail without a delivery method, and this is where the transport layer comes in.</p>

<p>Once we have an IP address, our browser will open a transmission control protocol (TCP) connection with the server located at the specified address. A server is just another machine, one designed to return information requested by a client (our machine).</p>

<p>Getting information between the client and server is not so simple.</p>

<p>In order to exchange a potentially large amount of information, we need to divide the request and response messages into smaller packets of information. There is no guarantee that they will arrive in the right order. There is no guarantee that they will not be lost.</p>

<p>TCP is like the postal service itself, if the postal service could actually prevent the things I've just described. Mail trucks, airplanes, and postal workers are all analogous to the transport layer. They carry your envelopes to a specified address, and they work their hardest to make sure that none are lost or delayed.</p>

<h2 id="theapplicationlayer">The Application Layer</h2>

<p>This is the core of our browser's activity, the information that we are trying to send and ultimately receive.  Communication at the application layer requires a protocol. In this case, it is the hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP). This is why URLs start with HTTP: it is an instruction to use a particular method of communication.</p>

<p>Your browser will send a request to google.com using HTTP. Google will respond in kind, and the HTTP response will contain the requested information.</p>

<p>At this point, the browser--the application--interprets the data, and renders it for you.  In the case of google.com, what we get back is a little bit of HTML, and a whole lot of Javascript and CSS.</p>

<p>The application layer is the writing in your mail. We write a nice note to Google asking them for information, and they respond with a handy webpage.</p>
